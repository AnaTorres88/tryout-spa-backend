 Hi, first of all, thank you for this opportunity, this is my entry for the tryouts. I added the requested functionality, plus a little extra.
 
 I created a simple node.js backend to showcase my backend skills.

## Instructions
1. Download both app and backend
2. install modules by writing ``` npm install``` in the terminal
3. run both projects at once
